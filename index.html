<em>Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things - they push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</em>  --Steve Jobs

<h2>My Goal</h2>
  <p>What is my goal? As a young man, this is the question asked most frequently by my parents, my friends and myself. I can't tell exactly, however. For a twenty-year old boy, life is long. But I know life is short.</p> 
  <p>We born to be ignorant. Ignorance consistently exists in the first fifteen years of most people's life. We may also suffer from physical or intellegence difficiency in the last ten years. Life is truly short.</p>
  <p>Therefore, I panic. For I hadn't achieved anything. For I haven't found my passion. But I'm twenty-one years old now. I'm exactly in my best years of my life. I haven't convincingly figured out how I would like to spend these years.</p>
  <p>But still, I have some clues of my desire. I want to be one member of the team that moves human being forward with technologies. I want to create something that make the masses enjoy the benefits brought by technologies to improve their life. I want inspire clever and ambitious young man to find their passion and enjoy learning.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I wonder what it feels to be a team member of those project/company: GPT-3, SpaceX, AlphaGo, iPhone, Mackintosh and Sora. These people proved something.Some of them changed the world.</p>
  <p>How fulfilling I would be if I were one of them.</p>

I grow little of the food I eat.

I do not make any of my own clothing.

I speak a language I did not invent or refine.

I did not discover the mathematics I use.

I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of and do not enforce.

I am moved by music I did not create.

I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object-oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.

I love and admire my species, living and dead.</p>
