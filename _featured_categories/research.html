<em><p>Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much more powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.</em>  -- <strong>Hans Moravec</strong> </p>

    <h2>Idea and Thinking</h2>
    <strong>Minecraft is a good place to do RL research:</strong><br>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Can do code as action: no motion/control difficulties because code rules minecraft. State can be retrieved by API. So can focus on lifelong embodied agent learning ratehr than solving the 3D perception or sensorimotor control problems.</li>  
        <li>Does not impose a predefined end goal or a fixed storyline but rather provides a unique playground with endless possibilities.</li>
        <li>Offline pre-training is ok because huge amounts of videos on Youtube.</li>
        <li>Curriculum is doable because clear hierachical level of tasks (resources needed & step length). </li>
    </ul> 

    <h2>Good Writing and Ideas From Others</h2>
        <a>An effective lifelong learning
            agent should have similar capabilities as human players: (1) propose suitable tasks based on its
            current skill level and world state, e.g., learn to harvest sand and cactus before iron if it finds itself in
            a desert rather than a forest; (2) refine skills based on environmental feedback and commit mastered
            skills to memory for future reuse in similar situations (e.g. fighting zombies is similar to fighting
            spiders); (3) continually explore the world and seek out new tasks in a self-driven manner.</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291">VOYAGER</a><br>
